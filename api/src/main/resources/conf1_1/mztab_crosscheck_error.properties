c_original_Smiles=The column "{0}" value "{1}" should obey a molecules structure of SMILES.
c_cause_Smiles=The molecules structure in the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).

c_code_InchiKey=3003
c_original_InchiKey= The column "{0}" value "{1}" should obey the standard InChI key.
c_cause_InchiKey=The standard IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) Key of the given substance.

c_code_OptionalCVParamColumn=3004
c_original_OptionalCVParamColumn=The column "{0}" value "{1}" should be a valid MS CV Parameter.
c_cause_OptionalCVParamColumn=by call web service of OLS to validate MS CV Parameter data type.

c_code_CvTermNotAllowed=3005
c_original_CvTermNotAllowed=The cv term "{0}" is not allowed for "{1}". Allowed terms are defined in {2}.
c_cause_CvTermNotAllowed=Cv terms must be allowed for particular elements in the mztab-mappings.xml file.

c_code_CvTermRequired=3006
c_original_CvTermRequired=The cv term "{0}" or children thereof must be reported for "{1}". Allowed terms are defined in {2}.
c_cause_CvTermRequired=A cv term must be reported for particular elements as defined in the provided mapping file.

c_code_CvTermRecommended=3007
c_original_CvTermRecommended=The cv term "{0}" or children thereof should be reported for "{1}". Allowed terms are defined in {2}.
c_cause_CvTermRecommended=A cv term should be reported for particular elements as defined in the provided mapping file.

c_code_CvTermOptional=3008
c_original_CvTermOptional=The cv term "{0}" or children thereof may be reported for "{1}". Allowed terms are defined in {2}.
c_cause_CvTermOptional=A cv term may be reported for particular elements as defined in the provided mapping file.
