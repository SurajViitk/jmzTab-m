= mzTab Swagger API
Nils Hoffmann <nils.hoffmann@isas.de>

This project defines the structure of an mzTab document based on JSON-Schema
and Swagger https://swagger.io/.

Swagger provides many templates to generate client / server implementations
based on a Swagger yaml or json definition.

This mechanism can be used to generate the domain-specific model classes in
any of the supported languages, omitting the web-specific parts.

The https://editor.swagger.io/[Swagger editor] can be used to import the file,
edit it with assistance and preview, and export it after editing. It additionally 
supports the generation of server and client code to represent the mzTab object structure.
